# Cyber Threat Intelligence Tools 🔍🛡️

This repository documents hands-on experiments with **Threat Intelligence tools** for cybersecurity analysis, incident response, and reconnaissance.  
The project demonstrates how open-source and community-driven platforms can be used to collect, analyze, and correlate Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), enhance incident detection, and improve response strategies.  

---

## 📌 Objectives
- Understand the role of **Threat Intelligence** in Incident Response (Preparation, Detection, Containment, Recovery, Lessons Learned).
- Explore tools and platforms for gathering and analyzing IOCs.
- Compare insights across **AlienVault OTX, Cisco Talos, Nmap, Kali Linux DNS tools, OSINT platforms, and VirusTotal**.
- Highlight practical use cases in **attack surface mapping, malware analysis, and email threat detection**.

## 🛠️ Tools & Platforms Used
- **AlienVault OTX** – community-driven threat feeds and IOCs  
- **Cisco Talos** – vulnerability & spam threat intelligence  
- **Nmap / Zenmap** – network discovery and topology mapping  
- **Kali Linux tools**:  
  - `dnsenum` – DNS enumeration (A, NS, MX, subdomains)  
  - `dnsmap` – brute-force subdomain discovery  
  - `dnsrecon` – advanced DNS record enumeration & zone transfers  
  - `fierce` – subdomain & DNS reconnaissance  
- **OSINT.sh** – DNS lookups, technology stack discovery, TTL analysis  
- **IP GEO tools** – mapping domains/subdomains to geographic locations  
- **VirusTotal** – multi-engine malware scanning and IOC enrichment
